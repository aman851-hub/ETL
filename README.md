As part of my learning in data analysis, I worked on the Titanic dataset to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset included passenger details such as age, sex, fare, class, and more.

Key Tasks Performed:

Loaded and cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and duplicates.

Analyzed the distribution of age, fare, and other numerical variables.

Used visualization techniques to explore gender distribution, survival patterns, and relationships between variables (e.g., Age vs Fare).

Filled missing values using techniques like mean imputation and categorical replacement.

Built histograms, count plots, and scatter plots to interpret data patterns.

Tools Used:
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
